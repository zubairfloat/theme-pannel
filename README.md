# Create by Zubair NextJS-Boilerplate

An unopinionated yet extensible starter fullstack boilerplate based on [NextJS 7](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-7/). This provides the build infrastructure and structure necessary to make any kind of React application, with or without an internal API. Testing with [Jest/Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/jest.html) and [Bundle Analysis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) comes built-in.

The server includes a lightweight API controller connected to the [RedHat Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/0.1/html/red_hat_security_data_api/). You can easily add your own controllers and database connections using this as a foundation.

## Quick Start

The application **REQUIRES** a configuration file located at `config/index.js` in order to run! This file contains top level config information and is omitted from source control. I like this approach because this keeps a record of how environment data is structured and is conflictless when run on a server with multiple applications.

```bash
# Install globals (cross-env is used to support windows, if you use that)
npm i -g cross-env
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Copy the example config file and customize
cp config/index.js.example config/index.js
vim config/index.js
```

```
npm run dev
```

## Build Process

```bash
# Compile the frontend, start the backend
npm run build
npm run start
# Please use forever to run this in prod
# ideally w/ a NGINX reverse proxy as well
```

## Test Suite / Bundle Analyzer

```bash
# Run the whole suite in different modes
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:watch
# Or test components individually
npm run test:single "Dashboard"
# Analyze dev & prod bundles
npm run analyze
```

### Build Infrastructure

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is used as boilerplate for our webpack config, SSR setup, and paramaterized routing. This includes hot-reloading for the client side, but we enable it for the server by using [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to monitor changes to the `server/`. The [configuration file](next.js.config) is fairly minimal, adding the necessary loaders to support SASS, fonts/images, and aliases like `components` and `enums` to replace relative imports on the client side.

The UI makes heavy use of [React-MD](https://react-md.mlaursen.com), an unopinionated SASS-based UI library. It's lighter and more extensible than Material-UI, but lacks the controlled features, events and API that Material-UI often provides with its stateful components. As a result, much of the code here handles low level operations like event handling, form data processing, etc.

Every `page/` component has an extra lifecycle method called `getInitialProps`. This is an async function that runs universally (both client and server) and is a blocking event that collects data before the page is rendered. This pattern allows us to continue writing declarative react without having to test the truthiness of our props constantly, because we can now assume the data has loaded. If the page fails to load API data, the user is redirected before anything renders and errors out. I've included error boundaries just in case, though (React 16's version of a try/catch).

## API

### Vulnerabilities and Exposures

**Source**: [RedHat Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/0.1/html/red_hat_security_data_api/)

This API allows the server and users alike to request information about any outstanding vulnerability that has been published (CVE or CVRF). Records can be queried in mass, or individually given a CVE ID.

Examples:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/cve
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/cve/CVE-2016-3706
```
